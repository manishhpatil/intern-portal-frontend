# 🧑‍💻 Intern Portal – Full Stack Internship Project

This is a basic **Full Stack Intern Portal** project that I built as part of the Round 1 task for a Full Stack Developer Internship.

The project includes:
- A simple frontend using React
- A basic backend using Node.js and Express
- Hosted on **Vercel** and **Render**
